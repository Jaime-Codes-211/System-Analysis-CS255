Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

Liam requested my software development team create an application for customers to practice written and driving exams to prepare for the DMV. A conference with the owner of DriverPass and my team presented the Business Requirement document describes the purpose and planning for the new app. System requirements include storage space, security and administrative access to customer relations and profiles mto enhance and maintain user experience. The functional requirements are to provide a highly detailed user profile, study materials, exams, driving instructor appointments for on the road testing and an update from the DMV informing DriverPass administration of course updates.

What did you do particularly well?

A User-Activity UML Diagram to display the DMV updates and paths to update testing information.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the class diagram and renew strategies to improve the messaging system.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I had recieved a design template and journaled expectations to deliver a new application for this project. DriverPass wants to help customers safely and accurately pass the DMV exam, the user needs are beneficial to the owner's vision and quality of the application.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I gather information and requirements from the start of the project. I preform tests to ensure the project is completely mapped and functional, last I ask the customer for feedback to validate completion or update the project for what the customer is requesting.
